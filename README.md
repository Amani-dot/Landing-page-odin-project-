# Odin Project - Landing page solution

This is a solution to the [landing page challenge on Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

### The challenge

"Get your project as close as you can to the design, but do not worry about getting it pixel-perfect. Don’t get out your ruler or count pixels to find the exact margins between the various sections. The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest. It doesn’t matter if you use margin: 24px when the design actually has margin: 48px."

## My process

Started with the HTML Structures first and then CSS styles.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

A lot about flexbox.

### Continued development

I hope to make it responsive in the future and instead of dummy text, make it a semi-real website.
